# Bash script collection

Scripts for the following purposes exist:

- **renameFiles.sh**: Rename files so that they can be back uped to an external hard drive having an exFAT/NTFS file system
- **backupScripts**: Bash scripts to back up to a kopia repository and using plain rclone (combination of kopia with rclone would be possible)
